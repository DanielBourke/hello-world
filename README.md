Hi everyone! 

Daniel here, I'm learning Deep Learning through Udacity as well as Machine Learning through Coursera. 

My dream is combine these two technologies/skills with my love for fitness and nutrition to bring value to the world. 

I want to help people move more and eat better. 

I'm enjoying learning Python as well as the math behind Deep Learning/Machine Learning. 

AI fascinates me, I wouldn't mind working for or creating an AI startup sometime in the future.
